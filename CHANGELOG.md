# Changelog

All notable changes to TokSave will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Cursor CLI agent**: Full support for the Cursor Agent CLI (`cursor` / `cursor-cli`). Wires user-global `~/.cursor/` config shared with the Cursor editor: native `hooks.json` `preToolUse` + `cli-config.json` `Shell(rtk *)` allow for RTK, `mcp.json` for CodeGraph and Context-Mode, and `AGENTS.md` instruction owners for Caveman, Ponytail, and Principles, with official brand icon `assets/agents/cursor.png`.
- **Warp Agent CLI MCP wiring**: Warp / Oz now writes CodeGraph and Context-Mode to the official desktop file (`~/.warp/.mcp.json`) and the standalone Agent CLI MCP file, in addition to the existing `~/.warp/mcp.json`. Detection also treats the `oz` binary and CLI config dir as installed. Doctor probe includes the new MCP paths.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-08-08

### Fixed

- **Windows: backslash paths break Git Bash hooks**: `toksave_abs()` returned native Windows paths (`C:\Users\...\toksave.exe`) which break in Git Bash (backslashes interpreted as escape characters). Now normalizes to forward slashes (`C:/Users/.../toksave.exe`) on Windows — valid in cmd.exe, PowerShell, and Git Bash. Users must re-run `toksave init` after upgrading to rewrite configs with safe paths. ([@jondmarien](https://github.com/jondmarien) in [#24](https://github.com/agungprasastia/toksave/issues/24))
- **Doctor probe false positives on non-toksave MCP entries**: `toksave doctor` probed every `"command"` key in agent config files, including user-owned MCP servers (e.g. `node`, shell builtins `[`, `if`), reporting spurious `binary not found` warnings. Probe now filters to toksave-owned commands only via `is_toksave_exe()` check. ([@jondmarien](https://github.com/jondmarien) in [#24](https://github.com/agungprasastia/toksave/issues/24))

## [1.0.2] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- **Codex RTK unwire deletes user `PreToolUse` hooks**: `unwire(Rtk)` removed the whole `PreToolUse` array, deleting user-owned hooks and potentially `hooks.json`. It now removes only the managed `rtk-hook codex` entry. Regression test added.
- **Codex Principles unwire accepts malformed `hooks` config**: A non-object `hooks` value was silently left in place while ownership metadata was removed. Unwire now returns a config error without changing either file or manifest.
- **Agent selector mismeasures Unicode hints**: Hint truncation counted Unicode characters instead of terminal display columns; wide CJK characters or emoji could still wrap a selector row. It now uses Unicode display width.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-08-04

### Fixed

- **Agent selector corrupts after terminal wrapping**: Long agent URLs could wrap on narrow terminals, while the interactive redraw assumed every option consumed one row. URLs are now truncated to the current terminal width so redraw height stays correct.
- **Agent selector corrupts on terminal events**: The selector reused a fixed number of cursor-up operations between frames; terminal resize or focus events could leave stale frames on screen. It now renders in an alternate screen and clears each frame.
- **Agent selector columns drift in raw mode**: Raw terminal mode disables automatic LF-to-CRLF conversion, so option rows began at the previous row's ending column. Selector rows now explicitly return to column zero.
- **UI progress bar splits multi-word agent names**: `Progress::stop` split status messages on the first space, causing multi-word agent labels (`Claude Code`, `GitHub Copilot`, `Devin / Cascade`, `Warp / Oz`) to wrap after the progress bar (`✔ Claude [████...] 100% Code`). Added `parse_label_and_tail` in `src/util/ui.rs` which matches against known agent/tool labels (sorted longest-first) before splitting. Unit tests added. ([@jondmarien](https://github.com/jondmarien) in [#23](https://github.com/agungprasastia/toksave/pull/23))
- **Doctor probe misreports managed hooks as missing**: `MANAGED_HOOKS` in `src/util/probe.rs` did not list `codex-perm-hook` or `context-mode-hook`, causing `toksave doctor` to treat them as unmanaged external binaries and report "binary not found". Both now registered. ([@jondmarien](https://github.com/jondmarien) in [#23](https://github.com/agungprasastia/toksave/pull/23))
- **Caveman version mismatch after update**: `installed_version()` always returned the hardcoded embedded fallback `1.9.1`, causing `toksave doctor` to perpetually report an upgrade available. Now writes the fetched release version to `cache_dir()/caveman.version` on install and reads it first. Bumped embedded `CAVEMAN_SKILL_VERSION` to `1.10.0`. ([@jondmarien](https://github.com/jondmarien) in [#23](https://github.com/agungprasastia/toksave/pull/23))
- **Legacy Bun binary paths persist across upgrades**: Old `/$bunfs/root/toksave` virtual paths in `~/.claude/settings.json` and `~/.codex/hooks.json` persisted because rewiring logic was not stripping stale paths. Claude `override_claude_rtk_hook` now replaces any existing `rtk-hook claude` command (including legacy paths) with the active binary path. Codex RTK wiring uses `merge_hook_group` for deduplication. ([@jondmarien](https://github.com/jondmarien) in [#23](https://github.com/agungprasastia/toksave/pull/23))
- **Codex `unwire(Principles)` leaves orphan `PermissionRequest` hook**: `wire(Principles)` added a `codex-perm-hook` to `PermissionRequest`, but `unwire(Principles)` only called `remove_owner` without cleaning the hook. Now removes managed `PermissionRequest` entries and prunes empty `hooks` object.

### Changed

- **Status coloring in `doctor` and `update`**: `all tools wired` and up-to-date versions now print in green; `not installed` / `not on PATH` in red; outdated versions in yellow. Consistent across both commands. ([@jondmarien](https://github.com/jondmarien) in [#23](https://github.com/agungprasastia/toksave/pull/23))
- **Generic `merge_hook_group` / `remove_hook_group`**: Refactored `merge_pretool_use` and `remove_pretool_use` in `src/util/json.rs` to delegate to generic `merge_hook_group` / `remove_hook_group` that work with any hook key (`PreToolUse`, `PermissionRequest`, etc.). Backward-compatible — existing callers unchanged.
- **CI `fail-fast: false`**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` matrix strategy no longer cancels sibling OS jobs on single-job failures. ([@jondmarien](https://github.com/jondmarien) in [#23](https://github.com/agungprasastia/toksave/pull/23))

### Added

- **Wiring matrix heatmap**: Added `scripts/generate_wiring_heatmap.py` (stdlib-only) that generates color-coded SVG heatmaps (`assets/wiring-matrix-dark.svg`, `assets/wiring-matrix-light.svg`) of the tool x agent wiring matrix. README updated with `<picture>` element for light/dark theme support. ([@jondmarien](https://github.com/jondmarien) in [#23](https://github.com/agungprasastia/toksave/pull/23))

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-02

### Added

- **100% Native Rust Core**: Complete rewrite from TypeScript/Bun to Rust 2024 edition — delivering zero-runtime dependency, faster execution, memory safety, and standalone cross-platform binaries.
- **Explicit `init` subcommand**: `toksave init` now accepted explicitly (was default-only).
- **Preflight git/node dep warning**: Before `init`, toksave warns when github-channel tools need git or npm-channel tools need a minimum Node version, and skips those tools with a remediation hint instead of failing mid-install.
- **Install failure diagnostics**: Failed tool installation now reports which command failed, its exit code, captured stderr tail, and remediation hints (ensure Node 18+ / npm / deno are on PATH, check proxy, retry).
- **Per-tool phase progress**: `toksave install <agent>` shows per-tool progress phases (resolve, install, wire) instead of one indeterminate spinner.
- **Runtime probe in `toksave doctor`**: Probes each agent's installed binaries and hooks at runtime — detects missing binaries, Windows backslash paths that break Git Bash hooks, and hooks that fail to run (3s live-run check); reports `hooks.json`/`config.toml`/`mcp.json` MCP server entries pointing at missing binaries. No hooks are modified.
- **Codex `config.toml` MCP probe**: Reads `[mcp_servers.*]` from `config.toml` via `toml_edit` (not regex) to detect broken MCP entries alongside the JSON-based walker.
- **`expected_bin_dirs` + PATH prepend in `toksave init`**: The workspace PATH is prepended with agent binary dirs so freshly installed tools resolve in new shells.
- **Legacy fence cleanup**: Old TokSave instruction fences (non-toksave markers) are stripped when regenerating `AGENTS.md` blocks.
- **Owner-consolidated `AGENTS.md` updates**: Rewrites group existing agent/RTK owners into one TokSave block instead of appending duplicates; a full-file `write_owner` no longer overwrites the entire `AGENTS.md`.

### Changed

- **`init` detects agents before installing tools**: Agent detection and selection now run before any tool installation. When no agent is detected, `toksave init` prints "Nothing selected." and exits without touching the filesystem (previously tools were installed and wired first, then "Nothing selected."). Selection options (all/high/leave-all) apply to upgrade runs; a fresh machine with no agents short-circuits cleanly.
- **Rust edition `2021` → `2024`**: Upgraded the crate to the 2024 edition. `env::set_var`/`remove_var` became `unsafe` in 2024; call sites in `runmcp`/`detect` got `unsafe` blocks with inlined safety comments (main-thread before thread spawn), and env-mutating tests got `unsafe` blocks guarded by `env_test_lock`/`ENV_LOCK`.

### Fixed

- **RTK hook no longer clobbers user PreToolUse hooks**: Warp, Devin, and Droid wire/unwire used to replace the whole `PreToolUse` array or drop the key outright, destroying user-owned hooks. Wire now keeps existing entries, replacing only toksave-managed ones (matched by command marker), and unwire drops only ours — removing the key only when it becomes empty.
- **Windows: bare npm shims now spawn correctly**: Tools installed by npm ship an extensionless POSIX shell shim (`context-mode`) next to a `.cmd` twin. TokSave used to prefer/resolve the bare shim and spawn it directly, failing with `os error 193 (%1 is not a valid Win32 application)`. Command resolution now prefers PATHEXT-qualified candidates on Windows, and `runmcp`/process spawning picks the `.cmd` twin — fixing `toksave runmcp <npm-tool>`, `toksave index`, and version probes on Windows.
- **`update` installs missing npm tools**: `latest_version()` read `.version` from the full npm registry document, which only exists on the `/latest` and versioned endpoints — so every npm tool resolved as "up to date" and `toksave update` never installed missing tools. Now fetched via `registry.npmjs.org/<pkg>/latest`; missing tools are reported as `(not installed)` and installed.
- **Uninstall drops empty config files and ghost keys**: After uninstall, agents left empty `{}` JSON configs, empty `[mcp_servers]` TOML tables, and empty `hooks`/`mcpServers` objects behind (opencode `config.json`, codex `config.toml`+`hooks.json`, copilot/droid/devin/warp `mcp.json`+`hooks.json`, `.claude.json`, `.claude/settings.json`). Unwire now prunes empty top-level JSON containers (`write_json_pruned`), prunes empty TOML tables recursively (`prune_empty_tables`) and deletes the file when it serializes to `{}`/empty (`write_toml_pruned` / `write_json_pruned`), while preserving user-owned keys like opencode's `$schema`.
- **Invalid `toksave install <tool>` remediation hints**: Health-check and repair hints referenced `toksave install <tool>`, but `install` is not a clap subcommand (error: unrecognized subcommand). All hints now point to the real command `toksave init -t <tool>`.
- **`update` mislabeled "up to date" when latest couldn't be resolved**: A tool that resolved its installed version but failed to fetch the latest (offline / GitHub rate limit) printed `→ ? (up to date)`, silently claiming freshness. It now prints `? (latest unknown — could not check)`.

## [0.8.5] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- **Warp / Oz Agent Support**: Added full support for Warp / Oz AI Agent (`warp` / `oz` CLI flag) with MCP (`mcp.json`) and `AGENTS.md` instructions wiring across all 6 tools, with official brand icon `assets/agents/warp.png`. ([@jondmarien](https://github.com/jondmarien) in [#22](https://github.com/agungprasastia/toksave/pull/22))

### Fixed

- **Warp hooks.json never clobbered on wire/unwire**: `loadHooks()` returned `{}` for an unparseable `hooks.json`, so the next write destroyed the user's hooks. It now returns `null` on malformed JSON and wire/unwire/verify skip the write. `removeHookGroup()` previously removed the entire matched hook group, deleting co-located user hooks — it now removes only the TokSave `rtk-hook` entry and keeps groups that still hold user hooks. Regression tests added.
- **Immutable sort without spread copy**: Replaced `[...owners].sort(...)` with `owners.toSorted(...)` in agent instructions rendering (ES2023, no intermediate array allocation).

### Changed

- **Dead code removal & command refactors**: Removed unused exports and deprecated helpers across the codebase (~720 lines): `src/util/progress.ts`, `src/util/separators.ts`, barrel files `src/agents/index.ts` and `src/commands/index.ts`, `src/content/rtk-rules.ts`, plus unused functions in `json`, `toml`, `colors`, `errors`, `manifest`, `mcpspawn`, `npm`, `paths`, `unified-block`, `version`, and `download` utilities. Refactored command approval (copilot) to use a `Set`, agent detection in `init` to use a `Map`, and `disable`/`doctor`/`uninstall`/`update` to use `reduce`/`Set` for clearer, faster logic. Enabled `noImplicitAny` in `tsconfig.json` for stricter type checking.

## [0.8.4] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- **Devin / Cascade Agent**: Added full support for Devin / Cascade AI agent (`devin` / `cascade` flag) with MCP (`mcp.json`) and `AGENTS.md` instructions wiring for all 6 tools. ([@jondmarien](https://github.com/jondmarien) in [#19](https://github.com/agungprasastia/toksave/pull/19))

### Fixed

- **`runmcp` CLI argument parsing**: Added `.argument("[args...]")` and `.allowExcessArguments(true)` to `runmcp` command registration in Commander. Prevents "too many arguments for 'runmcp'" failures when agents launch MCP servers with parameters. ([@jondmarien](https://github.com/jondmarien) in [#19](https://github.com/agungprasastia/toksave/pull/19))
- **Bare MCP tool binary resolution**: `runmcp` now automatically resolves bare tool names (e.g. `codegraph`, `context-mode`) to their installed executables on PATH or user bin directories (`~/.local/bin`, mise shims, etc.). ([@jondmarien](https://github.com/jondmarien) in [#19](https://github.com/agungprasastia/toksave/pull/19))
- **GUI agent PATH expansion**: `runmcp` now ensures `PATH` includes user tool paths (`~/.local/bin`, mise node shims, etc.) so GUI desktop agents with minimal PATH environments can locate `node`, `codegraph`, and `context-mode`. ([@jondmarien](https://github.com/jondmarien) in [#19](https://github.com/agungprasastia/toksave/pull/19))
- **Caveman install fallback**: `caveman` tool installation now succeeds gracefully even if global npm installation fails or npm is absent, ensuring instruction-based skill wiring still completes. ([@jondmarien](https://github.com/jondmarien) in [#19](https://github.com/agungprasastia/toksave/pull/19))
- **`toksave doctor` deep MCP verification**: `doctor` now performs executable-level verification (`checkAgentMcpHealth`) for `codegraph` and `context-mode`, catching unresolvable or crashing MCP configurations rather than relying solely on config file presence. ([@jondmarien](https://github.com/jondmarien) in [#19](https://github.com/agungprasastia/toksave/pull/19))

## [0.8.3] - 2026-07-17

### Fixed

- **Manifest recorded before verify**: `init` called `recordWire()` before `verifyTool()`. Failed wiring still left a manifest entry. Now records only after verify passes.
- **RTK verify required PATH**: Claude Code and OpenCode `verify("rtk")` required `isOnPath("rtk")` in addition to the hook/plugin. Fresh installs with RTK not yet on PATH failed verify after a successful wire. Verify now checks hook/plugin only; PATH health stays in doctor.
- **Copilot IDE instructions stale after unwire**: Unwire for codegraph/context-mode/caveman/ponytail/principles removed CLI owners but did not re-sync `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. Now calls `syncCopilotIdeInstructions()`; empty body deletes the IDE file.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- **Verify-after-wire regression test**: 6 new tests confirm dry-run wire does not pass verify for any agent×tool combo. Exposes missing dryRun guards in wire functions.

### Fixed

- **WireCaveman dryRun writes owner marker**: Claude Code and Antigravity `wireCaveman()` called `writeOwner()` even with `dryRun: true`, causing verify to falsely report caveman as wired. `writeOwner` now correctly skipped on dryRun.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-07-17

### Changed

- **Verify after wire**: Init command now calls `verifyTool()` after `wireTool()` succeeds. If verification fails, the tool is reported as not wired — matching tokless behavior. Prevents silent wiring failures.
- **Pre-flight dependency check**: Init command now uses unified `ensureDeps()` instead of ad-hoc `checkNode()`. Ready for git dep checks.

### Fixed

- **Agent detect false positives**: Config-dir fallback in `detect()` now only activates under `NODE_ENV=test` for all agents (claude, droid, antigravity, copilot). Prevents `~/.factory`, `~/.gemini`, or project-level `.vscode/mcp.json` from triggering false detection.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- **Auto-index on agent startup**: CodeGraph index builds automatically when agents start, not just on install.
  - **Claude Code**: SessionStart hook in `~/.claude/settings.json` runs `toksave index --auto` on each session start.
  - **OpenCode**: `plugins/toksave-autoindex.js` fires on first `tool.execute.before` call.
  - Both agents install/remove/verify the auto-index through `wire("codegraph")` / `unwire("codegraph")` / `verify("codegraph")`.

- **New agents: Copilot and Droid**: Full agent manifest, detection, wire/unwire/verify for all 6 tools (RTK, Caveman, CodeGraph, Context-Mode, Ponytail, Principles). Added to registry, agent index, and matrix test.
  - [src/agents/copilot.ts](src/agents/copilot.ts) — GitHub Copilot agent with MCP + IDE MCP wiring, RTK hook, CodeGraph index hook, Context-Mode hook, copilot-instructions.md sync.
  - [src/agents/droid.ts](src/agents/droid.ts) — Droid agent with MCP + AGENTS.md wiring, PreToolUse hook removal for context-mode.

- **New tools: Ponytail and Principles**:
  - [src/tools/ponytail.ts](src/tools/ponytail.ts) — Ponytail npm package, version detection, install/uninstall.
  - [src/tools/principles.ts](src/tools/principles.ts) — Principles tool with owner-based verify.

- **Unified-block content system**: Replaced per-agent ctx-rules/rtk-rules with a shared `unified-block.ts` content system using marker-based blocks. All agents now share a single `agent-instructions.ts` for standard content blocks.
  - [src/util/unified-block.ts](src/util/unified-block.ts) — `writeOwner()`, `removeOwner()`, `hasOwner()`, `writeBlock()`, `removeBlock()` helpers.
  - [src/util/separators.ts](src/util/separators.ts) — Standard marker separators.
  - [src/content/agent-instructions.ts](src/content/agent-instructions.ts) — Unified content templates.
  - Migrated Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, Antigravity from ctx-rules/rtk-rules blocks.

- **Caveman marketplace & skills CLI**: Caveman now supports installing skills from marketplace URLs, has a `skills` subcommand, and an OpenCode plugin for skill discovery.
  - [src/tools/caveman.ts](src/tools/caveman.ts) — `installCavemanSkill()`, `resolveCavemanBin()`, `registerCavemanOpencode()`, `installedSkills()`, `opencodePluginInstalled()`, marketplace URL support.

- **Progress tree & runStatus**: New [src/util/progress.ts](src/util/progress.ts) with `SectionProgress`, `RootSectionProgress`, `runStatus()` spinner with dynamic sections.

- **Version utils & health**: New [src/util/version.ts](src/util/version.ts) with `gatherVersions()`, `semverCompare()`, `semverGte()`, `countOutdated()`. New [src/util/deps.ts](src/util/deps.ts) with `ensureDeps()`. New [src/util/mcpspawn.ts](src/util/mcpspawn.ts) with `pickMcpSpawn()`, `wrapAutoIndex()`.

- **Enhanced colors**: [src/util/colors.ts](src/util/colors.ts) now exports `C` (Cyan, Bold, etc), `L` logger with `.sub()` / `.ok()`, `StdoutIsTTY`.

- **CodeGraph real install**: [src/tools/codegraph.ts](src/tools/codegraph.ts) now has `realInstall()` with progress bars, background auto-index via `codegraphIndexBg()`, and `indexProject()` that discovers and indexes directories.

- **Context-Mode for Copilot + Droid**: Added context-mode wiring for the two new agents in [src/tools/caveman.ts](src/tools/caveman.ts) (codex handler cleanup) and [src/agents/copilot.ts](src/agents/copilot.ts) / [src/agents/droid.ts](src/agents/droid.ts).

- **RTK hook override + stripRtkRef**: [src/agents/claude.ts](src/agents/claude.ts) now includes `overrideClaudeRtkHook()` to replace existing RTK hooks, and `stripRtkRefFromMd()` to clean up old references.

- **Matrix test (36 combos)**: New parametrized test in [src/__tests__/agents.test.ts](src/__tests__/agents.test.ts) covering all 6 agents × 6 tools wire→verify→unwire→verify cycles.

### Changed

- **Agent wiring migration**: Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, Antigravity wiring moved from ctx-rules/rtk-rules content system to unified-block content system. Antigravity GEMINI.md rules cleaned up. Codex context-mode hook cleanup.

- **Paths extended**: [src/util/paths.ts](src/util/paths.ts) added `toksaveAbs()`, `copilotPaths()`, `droidPaths()`, `opencodeKnownBinDirs()`, `opencodeDesktopPaths()`.

- **Registry expanded**: [src/registry.ts](src/registry.ts) now includes Copilot, Droid, Ponytail, Principles agents and tools. Added `ALL_AGENTS` export with full agent manifest data.

- **CLI updated**: [src/cli.ts](src/cli.ts) and [src/index.ts](src/index.ts) register new commands, dry-run flag support, colorized output.

- **Commands enhanced**: `doctor` now shows `--offline` status cleaner. `update` handles Copilot/Droid. `uninstall` handles new agents/tools. `runmcp` now supports `--agent` flag, `disable` command added. `build-index` updated for codegraph changes.

### Fixed

- **Opencode context-mode verify**: `verify("context-mode")` was checking `mcp.context-mode` which gets deleted during wire (plugin entry used instead). Changed to check plugin array. Also fixed `unwire` to remove the plugin entry instead of the missing MCP entry.

- **Caveman SKILL.md version fallback**: `cavemanInstalled()` now checks for the version field in SKILL.md, falling back to the constant only when absent.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-07-06

### Fixed

- **Caveman outdated detection was a no-op**: `healthCheck()` in [src/tools/caveman.ts](src/tools/caveman.ts) compared `installedVersion()` against the bundled `CAVEMAN_SKILL_VERSION` constant, but `installedVersion()` itself falls back to that same constant when SKILL.md has no version field (which the official one doesn't). Removed the dead comparison — outdated detection is already handled correctly by `doctor.ts` via the async `latestVersion()` GitHub fetch.

### Added

- **Caveman test coverage**: New [src/__tests__/caveman.test.ts](src/__tests__/caveman.test.ts) covering `healthCheck()` (installed vs not-installed) and `latestVersion()` resilience on network failure.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- **RTK native hook enforcement for Claude Code and OpenCode**: RTK enforcement upgraded from text-only instructions (AGENTS.md) to native agent mechanisms — Claude Code now uses a `PreToolUse` hook with `updatedInput` to auto-prefix Bash commands, OpenCode now uses a `tool.execute.before` plugin in `~/.config/opencode/plugins/`. This matches the hook-based enforcement Codex and Antigravity already had. AGENTS.md instructions retained as fallback/documentation.
  - Modified [src/agents/claude.ts](src/agents/claude.ts) to wire RTK via `PreToolUse` hook
  - Modified [src/agents/opencode.ts](src/agents/opencode.ts) to wire RTK via OpenCode plugin system
- **RTK unreachable binary detection**: New `isInstalledButUnreachable()` in [src/tools/rtk.ts](src/tools/rtk.ts) detects when RTK binary exists in `localBin()` but is missing from system PATH. `doctor` now shows actionable per-platform instructions (Unix shell rc vs Windows `setx`).

### Changed

- **Atomic multi-file writes in Antigravity wiring**: `wireMcp()` and `allowEntry()` in [src/agents/antigravity.ts](src/agents/antigravity.ts) now roll back all successfully-written files if any write in the batch fails, preventing half-wired states.

### Fixed

- **Null-safety in Codex hook removal**: `removeRtkHook()` in [src/agents/codex.ts](src/agents/codex.ts) now handles `readJsonFile()` returning null with `?? {}` fallback. Audited and applied same pattern across all `src/agents/*.ts` modules.
- **Test isolation: replaced global mock.module with scoped spyOn**: Removed `mock.module("../util/exec.js")` from [src/__tests__/rtk.test.ts](src/__tests__/rtk.test.ts) and replaced with `spyOn` + `mockRestore()` per-test, matching the pattern already used for `isOnPath` in [src/__tests__/agents.test.ts](src/__tests__/agents.test.ts). Eliminates cross-file mock contamination that caused inconsistent CI failures across OS.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-07-05

### Added

- **Agent wiring regression tests**: Added temp-home tests for Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, and Antigravity `wire()`, `unwire()`, and `verify()` flows without touching real user config.

### Changed

- **Doctor auto-repair**: Added `toksave doctor --fix` to run existing tool health checks and repair unhealthy tool installations, while keeping default `doctor` read-only.

### Fixed

- **Null-safe config reads**: Fixed Claude Code, OpenCode, and Antigravity MCP removal/verification when config files do not exist yet.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-03

### Added

- **RTK auto-on for all agents**: Added RTK instruction blocks to AGENTS.md/instructions.md for all 4 AI agents, completing the "run once, everything works" philosophy
  - Created [src/content/rtk-rules.ts](src/content/rtk-rules.ts) with RTK usage instructions and helper functions
  - Modified [src/agents/claude.ts](src/agents/claude.ts) to inject RTK rules into Claude Code AGENTS.md
  - Modified [src/agents/opencode.ts](src/agents/opencode.ts) to inject RTK rules into OpenCode AGENTS.md
  - Modified [src/agents/codex.ts](src/agents/codex.ts) to inject RTK rules into Codex instructions.md (alongside existing PreToolUse hook)
  - Modified [src/agents/antigravity.ts](src/agents/antigravity.ts) to inject RTK rules into Antigravity AGENTS.md (alongside existing PreToolUse hook)
  - Instructions guide when to use `rtk` prefix for commands with large output, complement existing hooks where available
  - Claude Code and OpenCode now have RTK guidance via instructions (no hook support)
  - Codex and Antigravity have both hooks (auto-prefix) and instructions (guidance for edge cases)

### Changed

- **Caveman auto-fetch from GitHub**: Updated Caveman to fetch real SKILL.md content and versions from official source instead of hardcoded value
  - Modified [src/tools/caveman.ts](src/tools/caveman.ts) `latestVersion()` to fetch from GitHub releases API (https://api.github.com/repos/JuliusBrussee/caveman/releases/latest)
  - Added [src/tools/caveman.ts](src/tools/caveman.ts) `getSkillContent()` to fetch official SKILL.md from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman/main/skills/caveman/SKILL.md
  - Modified [src/agents/claude.ts](src/agents/claude.ts), [src/agents/antigravity.ts](src/agents/antigravity.ts) to use fetched content when wiring Caveman
  - Updated [src/content/caveman-skill.ts](src/content/caveman-skill.ts) `CAVEMAN_SKILL_VERSION` from "1.0.0" to "1.9.1" to match current official version
  - Users now get the latest Caveman skill content automatically on install/update
  - Local template remains as fallback when GitHub fetch fails
  - Philosophy fulfilled: all tools (RTK, CodeGraph, Context-Mode, Caveman) now fetch latest from official sources

### Fixed

- **Manifest race conditions & parse safety**: Implemented file-based locking (`manifest.json.lock`) and atomic temp-write-rename pattern to prevent manifest corruption. Added parse error warnings instead of silent config resets.
- **Safe configuration writes**: Updated config writers to throw on parse failures instead of returning empty objects/null, preventing existing configs from being overwritten on syntax errors. Implemented atomic file writes for all configuration files.
- **Codex hook preservation**: Refactored RTK hook wiring to merge hooks into `PreToolUse` and `PermissionRequest` instead of completely overwriting them. Removed global `approval_policy = "never"` mutation to avoid modifying user settings outside TokSave scope.
- **Antigravity multi-surface MCP safety**: Modified MCP wiring and settings updates to aggregate partial file write failures and throw explicit errors instead of failing silently. Corrected Context-Mode hook command path proxy target.
- **Tar archive path traversal safety**: Added path validation checks for `.tar.gz` extractions to prevent directory traversal exploits.
- **RTK installation fallback & cleanup**: Ensured downloaded RTK binary is removed if initial integration setup (`rtk init -g`) fails. Added script/cargo install fallbacks on GitHub release asset failures.
- **RTK local path resolution**: Updated version detection to search the local bin directory when `PATH` is not yet updated.
- **Indeterminate progress reporting**: Fixed download progress callback to trigger even when `Content-Length` is not provided (e.g. GitHub chunked transfers).
- **Rule upgrade refresh & validation**: Modified rules wiring to overwrite rule blocks on upgrade instead of skipping early. Improved verification checks to inspect rule presence in `AGENTS.md` and `instructions.md`.
- **Network timeout in fetches**: Added a 10-second timeout to all remote fetches (rtk, caveman, npm) to prevent indefinite hangs on poor connections.
- **Regex rule markers**: Improved rules removal regex to be resilient to carriage returns (`\r?\n`) and flexible whitespace formatting.
- **MCP idempotency**: Replaced fragile `JSON.stringify` comparisons with field-by-field validation to prevent false negatives caused by key ordering.
- **Caveman version detection**: Fixed `installedVersion()` returning "0.0.0" when official SKILL.md has no version field, and added support for detecting version from OpenCode and Codex instructions.
- **Caveman content extraction robustness**: Increased buffer from 12 to 20 lines in `getCavemanInstructionBlock()` for better handling of content structure changes.
- **CodeGraph CI hang**: Removed `-i` interactive flag from `codegraph init` that caused indefinite hangs in non-interactive environments (CI, background processes).
- **Remaining dynamic `require()` calls**: Replaced leftover `require("../content/ctx-rules.js")` in [src/agents/claude.ts](src/agents/claude.ts) and `require("node:path")` calls in [src/agents/antigravity.ts](src/agents/antigravity.ts) with static ES imports.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-03

### Added
- **Missing hook commands**: Added `rtk-hook` and `context-mode-hook` CLI commands that were referenced in Codex and Antigravity agent wiring but didn't exist, causing RTK and Context-Mode hooks to fail silently
  - [src/commands/rtk-hook.ts](src/commands/rtk-hook.ts) - PreToolUse hook that prefixes Bash commands with `rtk`
  - [src/commands/context-mode-hook.ts](src/commands/context-mode-hook.ts) - PreInvocation hook that proxies to context-mode CLI
  - Updated [src/cli.ts](src/cli.ts) and [src/index.ts](src/index.ts) to register both commands
- **User-Agent with version**: Created `userAgent()` helper in [src/util/version.ts](src/util/version.ts) that returns `toksave/<version>` for better debugging of API issues
  - Updated all HTTP requests in [src/util/download.ts](src/util/download.ts), [src/tools/rtk.ts](src/tools/rtk.ts), and [src/util/npm.ts](src/util/npm.ts)
- **Test step in release workflow**: Added `bun test` step in [.github/workflows/release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml) before building release artifacts to prevent shipping broken binaries
- **Stricter TypeScript checks**: Added `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch` to [tsconfig.json](tsconfig.json) and fixed all 27 resulting type errors across the codebase

### Fixed
- **Security: Zip slip vulnerability**: Added path validation in [src/util/download.ts](src/util/download.ts) `downloadZip()` to prevent malicious archives from writing files outside the destination directory
  - Rejects absolute paths, path traversal sequences (`../`), and entries that escape destDir
- **Security: Config parse errors silently swallowed**: Added warnings when [src/config/json.ts](src/config/json.ts) and [src/config/toml.ts](src/config/toml.ts) fail to parse config files, preventing silent data loss when users make typos
- **semverCmp invalid input bug**: Fixed [src/util/version.ts](src/util/version.ts) to return `-1` instead of `0` when version parsing fails, preventing updates from being silently skipped
- **makeExecutable silent error**: Fixed [src/util/download.ts](src/util/download.ts) to throw error with remediation message instead of silently ignoring chmod failures
- **Dead code in RTK health check**: Removed unreachable `!isOnPath("rtk")` check in [src/tools/rtk.ts](src/tools/rtk.ts) that could never be true if `installedVersion()` succeeded
- **Dynamic require() usage**: Replaced dynamic `require()` calls with static ES imports in [src/util/paths.ts](src/util/paths.ts), [src/agents/claude.ts](src/agents/claude.ts), and [src/agents/antigravity.ts](src/agents/antigravity.ts)
- **Windows platform support**:
  - Added Windows-specific Node.js directories in [src/util/detect.ts](src/util/detect.ts) `resolveNode()`
  - Added proper Windows fallback for `localBin()` in [src/util/paths.ts](src/util/paths.ts) when LOCALAPPDATA is unset
- **Deleted misleading barrel file**: Removed [src/tools/index.ts](src/tools/index.ts) that only re-exported RTK while registry imports all tools directly

### Changed
- **Checksum verification**: Implemented SHA256 verification using existing `DownloadOptions.checksum` field in [src/util/download.ts](src/util/download.ts) for `downloadFile()`, `downloadTarGz()`, and `downloadZip()`
- **fetchJson retry logic**: Updated [src/util/download.ts](src/util/download.ts) `fetchJson()` to use `fetchWithRetry()` for consistent network resilience across all download operations
- **Pinned @types/bun version**: Changed from `"latest"` to `"1.3.14"` in [package.json](package.json) to prevent CI/local divergence
- **Updated actions/checkout**: Changed from `@v4` to `@v7` in [.github/workflows/release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml) for consistency with build job
- **Removed dead tsconfig options**: Removed `outDir` and `rootDir` from [tsconfig.json](tsconfig.json) as they're meaningless with `noEmit: true`
- **Extracted fetchBuffer helper**: Deduplicated 15-line chunk-reading logic between `downloadTarGz()` and `downloadZip()` in [src/util/download.ts](src/util/download.ts) by extracting shared `fetchBuffer()` helper

## [0.4.1] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed
- **Caveman version tracking**: Fixed bug where Caveman showed version "0.0.0" even after running `toksave update`
  - Root cause: `wireCaveman()` functions only wrote skill files if they didn't exist, so update operations never rewrote old files with the new template containing `version: 1.0.0`
  - Modified agent wire functions in [claude.ts](src/agents/claude.ts) and [antigravity.ts](src/agents/antigravity.ts) to rewrite skill files when `opts.upgrade` is true
  - Enhanced `installedVersion()` in [caveman.ts](src/tools/caveman.ts) to check both Claude Code and Antigravity skill paths (previously only checked Claude Code)

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added

#### Enhanced Error Handling (Sprint 1.1)
- **Structured Error Classes**: Introduced comprehensive error hierarchy with context and remediation guidance
  - `ToolError`: Base error class with error codes and structured context
  - `InstallError`: Installation failures with actionable remediation steps
  - `DownloadError`: Network download failures with HTTP status codes
  - `NetworkError`: Network connectivity issues with retry suggestions
  - `HealthCheckError`: Health check failures with diagnostic information
  - `IntegrityError`: Checksum/integrity verification failures
  - `PlatformError`: Unsupported platform errors with fallback suggestions
  - `IndexError`: CodeGraph indexing failures with permission/binary checks
- **Actionable Error Messages**: All errors now include root cause explanation, specific remediation steps, relevant context (URLs, file paths, status codes), and caused-by stack traces for debugging

#### Health Check & Repair System (Sprint 1.2)
- **Tool Health Checks**: Added `healthCheck()` method to all tools
  - RTK: Verifies binary installation, PATH configuration, and version detection
  - CodeGraph: Checks npm package installation and binary availability
  - Context-Mode: Validates npm global installation
  - Caveman: Verifies skill file presence and version compatibility
- **Automated Repair**: Added `repair()` method to all tools that attempts automatic fixes for common installation issues
- **Health Status Types**: New structured health status interface with `HealthStatus`, `HealthIssue`, and `RepairResult`

#### Download Resilience (Sprint 1.3)
- **Retry Logic**: Implemented exponential backoff for network requests (default 3 retries with 1s, 2s, 4s delays)
- **Progress Reporting**: Added `onProgress(downloaded, total)` callback support for real-time progress on large downloads
- **Download Options**: New `DownloadOptions` interface with configurable `retries`, `timeout`, `onProgress`, `checksum`, and `fallbackUrls`

#### Caveman Version Tracking (Sprint 4)
- **Version Management**: Caveman skill now tracks semantic versions with `CAVEMAN_SKILL_VERSION` constant
- **Version Comparison**: Health check detects outdated skills and warns when installed version doesn't match latest
- **Backward Compatibility**: Old skills without version field default to "0.0.0"

### Changed

#### Tool Improvements
- **RTK**: Enhanced installation error handling, post-install verification, better platform detection errors
- **CodeGraph**: Replaced dynamic `require()` calls with static ES imports for type safety, enhanced `indexProject()` with `IndexResult` and `IndexOptions` interfaces
- **Context-Mode**: Enhanced error handling for npm installation failures, added health check for PATH verification
- **Download Utilities**: Refactored all download functions to use `fetchWithRetry()`, added streaming progress support, better HTTP error status handling
- **npm Utilities**: Enhanced `installGlobal()` error handling with npm configuration troubleshooting hints

### Fixed
- CodeGraph: Fixed silent failures in `indexProject()` (now throws `IndexError`)
- Download: Fixed missing error context in download failures
- RTK: Fixed installation failures not reporting specific error causes
- npm: Fixed generic error messages that didn't help troubleshooting

### Technical Improvements
- All tool modules now export `healthCheck()` and `repair()` methods
- Registry exports `toolHealthCheck()` and `toolRepair()` dispatchers
- New [src/util/errors.ts](src/util/errors.ts) module with error class hierarchy
- New [src/util/health.ts](src/util/health.ts) module with health status types
- Enhanced type safety throughout download and installation flows
- All tests pass (56 tests), TypeScript compilation clean

## [0.3.1] — 2026-07-01

### Changed
- **UX Progress Delay**: Added a slight artificial delay during `init`, `update`, and `uninstall` commands. This ensures the progress spinner is always visible, preventing the terminal from appearing to flash instantly to completion.

### Fixed
- **MCP Proxy Path Resolution Bug**: Replaced `process.argv[0]` with `"toksave"` in `toksaveAbs()` to correctly resolve the executable path when installed globally via npm. This prevents catastrophic crashes where AI agents attempt to execute `node runmcp` instead of the TokSave binary.
- **Windows File Descriptor Leak**: Refactored MCP binary shebang detection (`isNodeShebangScript`) to use a robust `try...finally` block. This guarantees file handles are closed even during read errors, preventing `toksave` from permanently locking executable files on Windows.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-07-01

### Added
- **JSONC Config Preservation**: Replaced standard JSON parser with `comment-json`. TokSave now flawlessly preserves all user comments (`//`, `/* */`) and key order when modifying agent configurations like `settings.json`.

### Fixed
- **Windows Command Execution Bug**: Added `shell: process.platform === "win32"` to subprocess execution. Fixes catastrophic installation failures for global npm packages (like CodeGraph and Context-Mode) on Windows.
- **Node.js MCP Proxy Shebang Resolution Bug**: Fixed an issue where `toksave runmcp` attempted to spawn `toksave.exe` instead of `node` for node-based MCP servers. Tools now correctly resolve and execute using the system's `node` binary.
- **Async Fetch Refactor**: Removed anti-pattern synchronous Node subprocessing for network requests (`node -e 'fetch'`) in favor of native asynchronous API calls (`await fetch`), improving performance and environment portability.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-01

### Added
- **Codex Permission Auto-Allow (`toksave codex-perm-hook`)**: Intercepts Codex permission requests to automatically allow harmless commands and MCP tool calls. Drastically reduces manual prompts.
- **MCP Proxy (`toksave runmcp`)**: A secure wrapper to resolve Node.js binaries and proxy stdio. Ensures MCP servers run flawlessly across platforms (especially Windows).
- **Proactive Indexing (`toksave index`)**: New command to pre-build CodeGraph indexes in the current directory to speed up the agent's first query.

### Fixed
- **RTK MCP Compliance**: Fixed an issue where the RTK hook intercepted MCP tools in Antigravity. The matcher is now specifically restricted to terminal commands (`Bash`, `cmd`, etc.), restoring 100% MCP compliance.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-06-30

### Fixed

- **CLI Output:** Fixed an issue where the Caveman skill was incorrectly reported as `not installed` in the `toksave` and `toksave doctor` CLI summaries.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-30

### 🚀 Initial Release

Zero-config CLI that installs and wires token-saving tools into AI coding agents.
Built with TypeScript + Bun. Compiles to standalone binary — zero runtime dependencies.

### Added

- **Interactive wizard** — run `toksave` with no args, pick agents, everything gets wired.
- **4 agents supported** — Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, Antigravity.
- **4 tools installed** — RTK, Caveman, CodeGraph, Context-Mode.
- **5 commands** — `toksave` (install), `doctor`, `update`, `uninstall`, `self-update`.
- **`--agents` / `--tools` flags** — target specific agents or tools.
- **`--dry-run` flag** — preview changes without modifying anything.
- **`--verbose` flag** — detailed logs (which files written, which configs modified).
- **`--yes` flag** — skip interactive prompts, auto-select detected agents. CI-friendly.
- **Manifest tracking** — `~/.cache/toksave/manifest.json` records what toksave wired, so `uninstall` only removes what toksave added.
- **Full Caveman SKILL.md** — intensity levels (`lite`, `full`, `ultra`), persistence rules, auto-clarity, and boundaries.
- **Context-Mode routing rules** — injected into each agent's rules file (AGENTS.md or instructions.md). Redirects heavy operations through context-mode sandbox.
- **RTK auto-init** — `rtk init -g` called automatically after binary download to activate global shell integration.
- **OpenCode Caveman wiring** — writes caveman rules to `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`.
- **Codex Caveman wiring** — writes caveman rules to `~/.codex/instructions.md`.
- **Idempotent** — safe to run multiple times, no duplicate entries.
- **Cross-platform** — macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon), Linux (x64 + arm64), Windows (x64).
- **Install scripts** — `curl | bash` for Mac/Linux, `irm | iex` for Windows PowerShell.
- **CI/CD** — GitHub Actions for CI (3 OS) and Release (5 targets).
